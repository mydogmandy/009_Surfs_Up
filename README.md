# Module 009 / Surf's Up


Temperature data was received from 9 different weather stations on the island of Oahu:

## ***Temperature Evaluation for June & December from 2010-2017:***

**Notable temperature differences between the months of June & December across all years of data:**
1.  The temperatures in June have a much lower standard deviation with just 5 outlier recordings, meaning the temperature will be much more consistent in the summer
2.  The temperatures in December have a mean that is 5 degrees cooler plus a higher standard deviation plus twice as many outliers on the cooler side, meaning the temperature will be harder to predict in the winter
3.  There are minimum temperatures in December that may be too cool for surfing

### ***Recommendations for Further Analysis:***

* *The weather stations are concentrated on the right half of the island.  It might be a good idea to too if there are any stations on the left side of the island*
* *The analysis for the challenge was for temperature data.  To get a more accurate assessment, precipitation data should be included as well*
* *2 of the weather stations are on mountanous elevations.  Further analysis should be completed on each weather station to see where the outlier data is coming from*
